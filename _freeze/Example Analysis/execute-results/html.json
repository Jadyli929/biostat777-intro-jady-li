For example, it could be to a website or paper from where the original data came from or it could be to a paper describing a method you are using to analyze the data.\n\n-   Your analysis must include the use of at least 1 [margin content](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#margin-content).\n\n-   You must summarize your analysis and/or results with a paragraph (4-6 sentences).\n\n-   At the end of the data analysis, list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`) to help the TA with respect to making sure you met all the requirements described above.\n```\n\n## Background:\n\nEach person is composed of many types of emotions: fear, anger, happiness, sadness, etc. As we grow up, we might experiencing more complex and more diverse emotions. Without appropriate skills and abilities, we might lose control in dealing with our emotions and might have the risk of experiencing mental disorders.\n\nThe awareness that mental health is as important as physiological health is increasing in recent days. With the world developing so rapidly, there are improved treatments and diagnosis, as well as diverse services provided around world to help improve people's mental well-being. In order to help better support human beings' mental health, it is important to understand the trend of mental health status, so that better future treatments, policies, and services could be developed.\n\n![Inside Out 2](picture/inside_out2.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Research Question:\n\n1.  How does the trend of prevalence of mental health disorders change with time?\n\n2.  How does the prevalence of mental health disorders differ across the world ?\n\n### \n\n## Target Audience:\n\nThe intended audience for this analysis are researchers who are interested in knowing the trend of mental health disorders around the world in order to better inform future policy-making and/or treatments.\n\n## About Data:\n\n[Link to Data](https://data.world/vizzup/mental-health-depression-disorder-data)\n\n## Data Analysis:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"readxl\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprevalence <- df1 |> \n  summarise(across(-c(1:3), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))) # calculate average percent for each type of mental disorder\n\nnames(prevalence) <- str_extract(names(prevalence), \"^[^\\\\(]+\") #get rid of parenthesis in disorder name\n\nprevalence <- prevalence |> \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = everything(),\n    names_to = \"Mental Disorder Type\",\n    values_to = \"Average Percent\"\n  ) # change to long data\n\nprevalence <- as.data.frame(prevalence) |> \n  arrange(desc(`Average Percent`))\n\nggplot(prevalence, aes(y = reorder(`Mental Disorder Type`, `Average Percent`), x = `Average Percent`))+\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\")+\n    labs(title = \"Prevalance of Mental Disorder Types Around World\", y = NULL)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size=15))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Example-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Reference:\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#all-charts\n",
