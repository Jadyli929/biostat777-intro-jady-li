    "text": "Summary:\n\nResults\nAccording to Figure 1, different types of mental disorders distribute differently in the world. After averaging across regions and years between 1990 and 2017, Anxiety Disorders and Depression are the two most prevalent disorders, followed by Alcohol Use Disorder and Drug Use Disorders, with Schizophrenia having the lowest prevalence.\nAccording to Figure 2, most common mental disorders are positively correlated to other types of mental disorders: Anxiety is strongly correlated with Eating Disorders, Bipolar Disorders, and Drug Use Disorder, and is moderately correlated with Bipolar Disorder; Schizophrenia is moderately correlated with Eating Disorders and Anxiety; and Drug Use Disorder is moderately correlated with Eating Disorders.\nAccording to Figure 3, the prevalence of Depression tend to increase as people age. Specifically, there is a significantly higher prevalence among people who are 50+ years old compared to people who are &lt;50 years old. Additionally, teenagers are less likely to have Depression compared to elder people.\nAccording to Figure 4, different regions around the world tend to have similar pattern of the prevalence of Depression among different age groups: from year 1990 to 2017, the prevalence of Depression is almost stable for all regions; elder people (50+ years old) have higher prevalence of Depression while teenagers have the lowest prevalence, and prevalence increase as people age.\n\n\nConclusion\nBased on the above results, the following conclusions could be made. First, different types of common mental health disorders have different prevalence, with Anxiety and Depression are the most prevalent, and schizophrenia being the least prevalent among the world population between year 1990 and 2017. In addition, people tend to have multiple mental disorders at the same time, showing a high risk of comorbidity among the world population. Second, people have higher risk of getting Depression as people age, especially after 50 years old. Third, the pattern that people have higher risk of getting Depression remains stable across different regions in the world."
