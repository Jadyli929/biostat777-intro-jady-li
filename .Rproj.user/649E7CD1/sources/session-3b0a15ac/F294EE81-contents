1.  Use wget to download the students.csv file locally from here.
    
    $mkdir part3_data
    
    $cd part3_data
    
    $pwd
    
    $wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2024/refs/heads/main/projects/01-project/students.csv
    
    $ls 


2.  Display the contents of the students.csv file using the cat command.
    
    $ cat students.csv

3.  Display only the first 5 lines of the file using head to show the first few lines.
    
    $ head -n 5 students.csv

4.  Display only the last 3 lines of the file using tail to show the last few lines.
    
    $ tail -n 3 students.csv

5.  Count the number of lines in the file using the wc command to count the lines.
    
    Only return the number of lines without the file name: 
    $ wc -l < students.csv 

6.  Find all students who are taking "Math" as a subject using grep to filter lines with the subject "Math".
    
    $ grep "Math" students.csv

7.  Find all female students using grep or awk to filter based on gender.
    
    -F means use comma to seperate columns: 
    $ awk -F, '$4 == "F"' students.csv 

8.  Sort the file by the students' ages in ascending order.
    Use sort to order by the "Age" column.
    
    $ sort -t',' -k3 students.csv

9.  Find the unique subjects listed in the file.
    Use cut, sort, and uniq to extract unique subjects.
    
    $ grep -v 'Subject' students.csv | cut -d',' -f6 | sort | uniq


10. Calculate the average grade of the students.
    Use awk to sum the grades and divide by the number of students.
    
    $ tail -n +2 students.csv | awk -F',' '{sum += $5; count++} END {print sum / count}'

11. Replace all occurrences of "Math" with "Mathematics" in the file.
    Use sed to perform the replacement.
    
    $ sed 's/Math/Mathematics/' students.csv
